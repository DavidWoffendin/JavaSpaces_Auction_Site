####Assignment 1 â€“ A JavaSpaces Auction System   

This is the submission for the Auction JavaSpace application

The .idea folder is included so imports and run configurations should work fine but
if not then create a run configuration for auction main with the VM argument of:

    -Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false  -Djava.security.policy=policy.all
    
As for the dependencies again they should be imported but again if they fail 
they are included in the Jar Mods folder within the project:

    /Jar Mods/jsk-lib.jar
    /Jar Mods/jsk-platform.jar
    /Jar Mods/outrigger.jar
    /Jar Mods/reggie-dl.jar
    /Jar Mods/reggie.jar
    
Finally as stated only Auction Main needs to be run

The SpaceUtils file is already pointed towards Waterloo server
